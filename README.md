Abstract - This research paper presents an analysis of WHO-collected data on life expectancy and other socioeconomic indicators for 179 countries between 2000 and 2015. The techniques used for the exploration of the socioeconomic data were Factor Analysis and Multiple Linear Regression. With Factor Analysis, the data was narrowed down to two latent factors: Public Health Infrastructure and Nutrition/National Production. Using the solutions found with Factor Analysis, a Regression model was constructed with the computed factor scores. The regression model demonstrated that improvements to Public Health Infrastructure and reductions in disease had a substantial impact on Life Expectancy. Examples of policy improvements for vaccinations and youth nutrition are discussed, but not necessarily recommended without further study. Further analysis is recommended to explore how changes to the latent factors could improve the length of life.
